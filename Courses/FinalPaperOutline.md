## Final Paper: The role of cortical area 3a in proprioception

### MISC (TO BE INCORPORATED):
- Anatomical definition
- Discrepancies in location
- Projections from periphery
- Projections to periphery (gamma ?) 
- Projections to other areas
- Receptive fields
- Active/passive modulation
- Spindle-like responses
- GTO responses?
- Stimulation of area 3a 
  - London ... Miller
  - Taylor, Ellaway, ...
    - This wasn't area 3a, but what does this imply about cortical origins of gamma?
- Chronic recordings from 
- Future experiments to figure out what's going on
