## Function of the Cerebellum
#### Peter Thier 

### Misc notes
- Sea squirt

### Why do we have brains?
- Control action
- Deal with consequences of action

### Why do we have a cerebellum?
- Elephants have largest ratio of cerebellar to cerebral neurons of any mammal
  - ~97.5% of all neurons are cerebellar
  - Probably to coordinate complex trunk movements and use sensory information delivered by the trunk

### Cerebellar structures
- Granule cells (parallel fibers) send sensory signals
- Climbing fibers from inferior olive also synapse onto Purkinje dendritic tree
- Purkinje cells compare sensory predictions and project to cerebellar nuclei

### Cerebellar structure serves sensory systems
- Perception is the comparison of afference (ex- and reafference) with a sensory prediction via efference copy

### Electrical stimulation of cerebellar nuclei (outputs) evokes widespread BOLD responses
- Sensory and parietal cortices
- Cerebellar info necessary for sensory processing

### Theories of cerebellar function
- Apparently no evidence for inverse models in cerebellum? 
- Apparently not timing
- Apparently not motor coordination
- Motor learning and adaptation 
  
### Pruning of Purkinje cell simple spike population is the cerebellar basis of learning
- Climbing fiber signals are not error, but represent the learned behavioral changes themselves
  - "Gain increase adaptation"
