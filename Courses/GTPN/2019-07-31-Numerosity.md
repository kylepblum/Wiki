## Numerosity
#### Andreas Nieder

#### Deep networks for numerosity
- _Science Advances_ 2019 paper
- Train on object classification
- Look for numerosity as an emergent property of these networks
- Found units that behave identically to monkey neurons for numerosity

#### Numeric rule-switching
- Monkey chooses greater-than or less-than options
  - Red vs. blue
  - White w/ water drop vs. white w/o water drop

#### Dopamine modulation
- Dopamine microinjections improves discriminatory performance (D1 stim)
- Same occurs for D2 stim

#### Zero
