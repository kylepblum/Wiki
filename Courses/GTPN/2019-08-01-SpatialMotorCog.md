## Spatial Motor Cognition
#### Alexander Gail

### Frontoparietal sensorimotor system
- Dorsal and ventral pathways
- Dorsal premotor cortex and parietal reach region (V6A)
- Optic Ataxia caused by stroke causes problems with vision-guided reach
  - Especially outside of gaze

### Rule-based motor goal encoding in PRR
- Anti task
  - Monkey must reach opposite or same as target presented
  - PRR will respond with either with info about future movement or target presentation
  - Motor goal encoding rather than visual memory encoding

### Forward integration in fronto-parietal reach network?
