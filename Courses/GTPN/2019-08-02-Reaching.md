## Reaching
#### Aaron Batista

### Why do we care about reaching?
- Motor system as a window
- Impairments
- Origins of language
- Requires engagement of internal models

### Why is reaching difficult?
- Multiple DOF
- Multisensory integration
- Plans/internal models
- Spatial coordination
- Time delays
- Muscular complexity
- Hierarchical control

### Flash and Hogan Theory of Motor Control
- Minimum jerk trajectory

### Newer theories
- Signal-dependent noise
  - Goal is to make accurate movements
  - But neurons are noisy
  - For a given error tolerance, the neural command maximizes the speed

- Optimal feedback control
  - Multi-input, multi-output system
  - Redundant space can be exploited
  - Don't correct errors that don't hurt you

- Internal models
  - Can't just rely on sensory feedback

### Does M1 encode muscles or movements?
1. Muscles
- Evarts 1968: Spike triggered averaging
2. Movements
- Georgopoulos 1986: Cosine tuning
  - Population code for movement direction

### Another way to look at the problem
- M1 is a machine that gets the job done
