## Hand Grasping
#### Hans Scherberger

### Neurophysiology of hand actions
  1. Frontal and parietal areas preparing for action
    - AIP for hand (PRR or LIP for arm and eye respectively)
    - F5 for hand (PMd or FEF for arm and eye respectively)
  2. Record from AIP and F5 during grasping task 
     - Selectivity for grip type in AIP
     - Also neural tuning preference for grip orientation in AIP
     - AIP & F5 also encode reach and gaze position
