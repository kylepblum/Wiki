## GTPN 2019 Notes

### TODO List

### Ideas
1. *Classifiers for reach type or directions*
_Is the neural population able to separate self-movement from external perturbations happening simultaneously?_
  - Train to detect bump direction, test on move-bump data

2. *Exploration of force field and report direction of least force*
_Does active sensing improve proprioceptive acuity?_
  - Exploration phase for 3s
  - Ring reporting
  - Control: Targeted reaches through force fields

3. *VAE with muscle inputs and low-D muscle variables decoded*
_?_
  - Gives the VAE a task to perform
  - Make more bio-based
    - Not all to all connections for encoder
      - Cuneate single-receptive fields
    - Not all to all connections for decoder (dropout?, regional decoder?)
      - Limited white matter between brain areas
      - Different areas involved in different tasks

4. Muscle spindles as flexible internal models of motion
_?_
  - There are different theories of gamma function, which are difficult to test functionally b/c we don't know when exactly they occur in behavior
  - A mechanistic model of a single-muscle system is a good proxy, because we can control the relationship of alpha and gamma motor systems directly
  - 

5. *Neural net learns to control two-link pendulum*
_Do the motor and sensory layers result in multi-joint sworls based on muscle coordination?_
  - Train sensory map to decode joint anlges
  - Train motor map to reproduce EMG from same task, receiving only inputs from sensory layer
  - What principles do the resulting sworls organize based on?
  - Does the topography have a benefit compared to topographically random maps?
