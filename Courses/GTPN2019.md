## GTPN 2019 Notes

### TODO List

### Ideas
1. *Classifiers for reach type or directions*
_Is the neural population able to separate self-movement from external perturbations happening simultaneously?_
  - Train to detect bump direction, test on move-bump data

2. *Exploration of force field and report direction of least force*
_Does active sensing improve proprioceptive acuity?_
  - Exploration phase for 1s
  - Ring reporting
  - Control: Targeted reaches through force fields
