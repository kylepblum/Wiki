# Week 1 - Cells and Circuits
## Gordon Shepherd

### Corticospinal Neurons
#### Project via pyramidal tract to spinal cord
  - "Betz" cells
  - Includes corticomotoneuronal (CMN cells)
- Multiple muscles activate with single CMN cell spikes

### Mouse motor cortex circuits
#### Where is it?
  - (Other than layer 5 everywhere)
  - Many ways to define
  - Where thresholds are lowest for evoking movements (?)
#### Basic cell types
  - Excitatory projections
    - Mostly pyramidal neurons
  - 4 major classes
    - IT, PT, CT, TC
    - IT: intraelencephalic
      - Layers 2-6
    - CT: corticothalamic
      - Layer 6
    - PT: pyramidal tract
      - Layber 5B
    - TC: thalamocortical
      - Thalamus
  - These are mostly the same as we see in somatosensory cortex
#### Basic circuits
  - IT-4 doesn't have inter-area connections
  - IT <-> CT has strong connections
  - CT <-> PT is basically nonexistent
  - IT -> PT strong, PT -> IT weak
    - I_h - dependent 
  - Ventrolateral (VL) thalamus -> M1
    - Projects to IT-4, IT, PT (not CT)
  - CT -> thalamus
    - Strong CT to M1 projecting TC neurons
  - TC circuits of M1
