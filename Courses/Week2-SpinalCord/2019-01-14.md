# Week 2 - Spinal Cord
## CJ Heckman

### Motor unit and Henneman's size principle
- Ohm's law
- Small neruons get activated before large ones, given same synaptic current
- Fatigue is muscle fiber-type based
  - S(I) - most used, but slow and weak. Fatigue resistant.
  - FR(IIa) - medium, fast, strong, efficient, fatigue resistant
  - FF(IIb) - very fast, very strong 

### Serotonin & noradrenaline
- More synapses from serotonergic neurons in spinal motor neurons than spindle Ias
- Bi-stable firing: with seratonin, there is self-sustained firing after initial activation
- 





### Misc notes
- Only primates have monosynaptic connections to alpha motor neurons
- Seratonin regulates PICs
- Raphe nucleus: seratonin
