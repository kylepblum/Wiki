## Motor cortical representation of arm movement
### Two distinct pathways from motor cortex to spinal cord
 - Lateral corticospinal tract
  - 
  - Contralateral projections
 - Ventral corticospinal tract
  - Bilateral projections
### Premotor areas also project directly to spinal cord
 - SMA
 - Cingulate 
### Separate pathways for reaching and grasping between posterior parietal and motor

### Ed Evarts - pioneer in recording from neurons in behaving monkeys

### Collision test to determine where cortical cells are projecting
 - About 75% of cortical motor projections go to cerebellum
 - Stimulating electrode in spinal cord
