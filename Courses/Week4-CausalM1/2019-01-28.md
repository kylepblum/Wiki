## Understanding motor cortex through nerual activity perturbation

### Background
- Two ways to perturb neurons: actiate or inactivate
- Considering timescale of perturbation
- Perturbations are generally artificial

### Electrical stimulation
#### Surface stimulation - Fritsch and Hitzig 1870
- Discretization of cortex
- Originally thought to be eliciting percepts, not motor signals directly
#### Pyramidal tract drives muscle activation - Beevor and Horsley 1890
#### More focal stim reveals primacy of precentral gyrus in driing muscles - Grunbaum and Sherrington 1901
- First to describe that primary motor cortex was easiest to elicit movements in primates
#### Second motor map -  Penfield and Welch 1951
- Supplementary motor area
#### ICMS -  Rosen and Asanuma 1972
- Individual muscle stimulation possible
#### Triggered averages reveal complex muscle fields - Cheney and Fetz 1985
- Single stimuli can generate activation of multiple muscles
#### Microstim effects are context-dependent - Lemon 1995
#### ICMS Maps change with experience - Nudo et al 1996
- ICMS maps changed across training

### Inactivation experiments
#### Lesions in motor cortex causes movement deficits - Ferrier 1884
#### Movement can recover post-ablation - Ogden and Franz 1917


### Misc
- 30% of corticospinal neurons are in motor cortex
- Paper topic (?): retrograde tracing for gamma neurons
  - How do vesicles in spindles affect this?
  - If gammas are affected (Rathelot and Strick 2009), then why not synaptic-like vesicles in spindles --> descending command onto spindles
- Does training monkeys in their task remap their cortex?
