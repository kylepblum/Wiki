## Brain-machine interfaces
### Lee Miller

### Field potentials: Different recording technologies
- EEG
- ECog (subdural surface array)

### Single neurons
- Monkeys can learn to modulate individual neurons w/ biofeedback 
    - Fetz et al. 1971, _Science_
- First human BMI
    - Kennedy and Bakay 1998, _NeuroReport_
    - Cone electrode
- Premotor neurons can classify monkey's intended movements 
    - Santhanam et al. (Shenoy) 2006, _Nature_
    - Still the state of the art for classification
- Can we use M1 discharge to predict the direction of hand movement?
    - Population vector hypothesis
