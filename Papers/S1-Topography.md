## Mechanisms underlying the topographical organization of proprioceptive cortex

### Background
- Sensations of force, torque, movement, and orientation are functionally and
  psychophysically distinct proprioceptive modalities that originate from
  receptors within the limbs for which they provide sensation
- As with visual cortex, compressing a high-dimensional sensory space into a 2D cortical sheet produces 
- S1 neurons on same electrodes exhibit similar tuning properties 
- What are the neural mechanisms for such modality maps and topographical organization in proprioceptive cortex?

### Motivation

### Hypothesis
We hypothesized that so called modality maps are emergent from 

### Approach
We used a
