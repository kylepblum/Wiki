## A Signature of the Gamma Motor System Exists in Proprioceptive Cortex
#### Kyle P. Blum

### Introduction


### Results
#### S1 population exhibits fractional power relationship with hand speed in unperturbed movements

#### Decoders
*Velocity decoder trained on active reaches*
- Predicts velocity during active reaches, passive bumps, assistive bumps during reach
- Does not predict velocity during resistive bumps

*Velocity decoder trained on resistive bumps*
- Predicts both velocity and handle force during resistive bumps
- Predicts velocity during assistive bumps _okay_
- Does not predict velocity or force for active reaches, or passive bumps
