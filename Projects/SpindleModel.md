## Deviations from Manuscript model

### 2019-02-15
- Working on getting code to work with LimbLab data
- 10 ms bins
- Ran into some serious issues with stability
- Needed to adjust rates to take new time_step parameter so they would scale relative to time
- Need to clean up code, streamline data processing, remove buffer from data at end of simulations
