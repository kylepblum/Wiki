### Meeting with Leah Krubitzer
:S1:
- Area 5 v. area 2 intraoperatively
  - Even in anesthetized preps, area 2 will be clear
  - Area 5 will drop off
  - Intraparietal sulcus  is close to where border is
  - Area 5 moves more towards top of cortex as you move medially
- Leah has a video for area 3 recording
- Need to do histological analyses _post hoc_ 
- We should do intracortical single shank recordings
- They use ket/xyl mix for M1
- 3a, 2, 5 should all work for 1.5 iso
- Leah's paper has all the info for multiunit recordings
- Area 3a
 - Leah coming to Chicago for UofC talk 
 - She can meet with us
 - Maybe do terminal exp with Han
