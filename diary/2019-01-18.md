### Meeting with Aldo & Yufei
- Yufei progress on proximal arm data and modeling
- NaNs
  - Aldo: take our working data, append same data over and over until large
  - They downsample kinematics to 6 Hz
  - Plot power spectrum and figure out corner (first just downsample our data)
  - Check values of w throughout to make sure NaNs aren't happening
- K 
  - number of samples per input bin (upsampling neural outputs)
  - each bin has same probability of spike 
  - Maximum firing rate is 120 Hz (1/20*6)
    - This comes from the maximum firing rate 
      
- Pipeline
  1. Data collected at 60Hz 
  2. Calculate velocity (get distribution of velocity, downsample: every 6th sample)
  3. Data fed to NN to train model
  4. To recover firing rates, take 60samp/s data to produce firing rates
  5. 

- Check weights to see if they've converged (not loss function necessarily)
