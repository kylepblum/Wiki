### Meeting with Aldo & Yufei
:Aldo: :Yufei: 

- Why two linear layers in VAE model?
  - Pytorch defines linear layers, activations separately 
- Next steps for everyone
  - They need to collect human data
  - I need to validate Yufei's model with our data
  - 
- Should we do ultrasound?
  - Sono crystals?
- How do we find a coordinate system if none are muscle, joint, endpoint?
  - VAE is unsupervised, and hard to compare
  - If we know muscles and cortex, we can infer the intermediate coordinate system
  - What is the basis for Yufei's proposed constraint?
    - Each neuron will receive input number constraints
    - Each neuron will receive input number constraints 
- Sliman is doing something similar with hand proprioception
